## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **One File at a Time**
   - Don't try to build everything at once
   - Complete one file, test it, then move on

2. **Test Frequently**
   - After each change, check the browser
   - Fix errors immediately
   - Don't let errors pile up

3. **Use Your E-Commerce Project**
   - It has similar patterns
   - Copy structure, not exact code
   - Understand what you're copying

4. **Console.log is Your Friend**
   - Log data to see what you're working with
   - Log state changes
   - Remove logs when done

5. **Git Commit Often**
   - Commit after each phase
   - Write clear commit messages
   - You can always revert if needed

## 🚨 **Red Flags (Stop and Fix These)**

- ❌ Project won't start (`npm run dev` fails)
- ❌ Multiple TypeScript errors you don't understand
- ❌ API calls returning errors
- ❌ Nothing showing in browser
- ❌ You've been stuck on one thing for >1 hour

**If you hit a red flag:**
1. Stop coding
2. Read the error message carefully
3. Check the roadmap for that phase
4. Look at your e-commerce project
5. Ask for help if still stuck
